Manual Code Review Roadmap for Git ReadLater
Since this code was AI-generated, it's essential to perform a thorough review. Here's a structured approach to checking the codebase:

1. Security Review (Highest Priority)
API Keys & Credentials

Check .env files and environment variable handling
Verify no hardcoded secrets in the codebase
Review Supabase credential usage
Authentication

Review the GitHub OAuth implementation in supabaseClient.js
Check token handling and session management
2. Core Data Flow
Repository Saving Process

Follow the repository saving flow from SaveRepository.jsx through repositoryService.js
Review how GitHub API data is fetched and stored in Supabase
3. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Authentication Edge Cases

Review what happens when GitHub auth fails
Check token expiration handling
Network Failures

Examine error handling for GitHub API calls
Review error states in UI components
4. Database Operations
Supabase Integration
Check database schema against application requirements
Verify proper query construction and error handling
5. Frontend Components
State Management

Review React component state in main pages like Dashboard.jsx
Check for state inconsistencies and prop drilling issues
User Experience

Test responsive design on different screen sizes
Verify loading states and error displays
6. Performance Considerations
API Request Optimization
Review GitHub API usage for efficiency
Check caching implementation in CacheContext
7. Documentation & Configuration
README Completeness
Verify setup instructions match actual requirements
Check environment variable documentation
