# Git ReadLater Monetization Guide

This guide provides a detailed overview of the monetization strategy for the Git ReadLater application.

## Business Model

Git ReadLater uses a freemium business model with tiered subscription plans:

1. **Free Tier:**
   - Up to 100 saved repositories
   - Basic search functionality
   - Simple tagging system
   - Import from GitHub stars

2. **Premium Tier ($3/month):**
   - Unlimited saved repositories
   - Advanced search with multiple filters
   - Rich tagging system with nested tags
   - Automatic categorization suggestions
   - Export to third-party services (Notion, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### User Tiers and Repository Limits

The system tracks user subscription status and enforces repository limits:

- Free users are limited to 100 repositories
- Premium users have unlimited repositories
- The system notifies free users when they approach their limit (80% and above)
- When a free user reaches their limit, they cannot save additional repositories

### Paddle Integration

Paddle handles all payment processing, subscription management, and invoicing:

1. **Checkout Process:**
   - User clicks "Upgrade to Premium" button
   - System creates a Paddle checkout session
   - User is redirected to Paddle's hosted checkout page
   - After successful payment, Paddle webhook notifies our system
   - User's tier is updated in the database

2. **Subscription Management:**
   - Users can access Paddle's Customer Portal to:
     - Update payment methods
     - View invoices
     - Cancel subscription

3. **Subscription Lifecycle:**
   - Webhooks handle subscription events:
     - `checkout.session.completed`: Initial subscription payment
     - `customer.subscription.updated`: Renewal or plan change
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`: Cancellation


### Feature Implementation

The system enforces feature availability based on subscription tier:

1. **Repository Limit Enforcement:**
   - `canSaveRepository()` checks user's tier and current repository count
   - Dashboard shows subscription status and repository count
   - Save Repository page blocks saving when limit is reached

2. **Premium Features Access:**
   - Advanced search filters are only enabled for premium users
   - Rich tagging features are only available to premium users
   - Export functionality is limited to premium subscribers

## Analytics and Metrics

Track key subscription metrics:

1. **Conversion Rate:**
   - Percentage of free users who upgrade to Premium
   - Funnel analysis from free signup to Premium conversion

2. **Retention:**
   - Monthly churn rate
   - Subscription renewal rate

3. **Revenue Metrics:**
   - Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
   - Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
   - Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

## Future Monetization Opportunities

Potential expansion of the monetization strategy:

1. **Team/Organization Plans:**
   - Shared repository collections for teams
   - Collaborative tagging and notes
   - Team management features

2. **Additional Tiers:**
   - Pro tier with advanced features for $8/month
   - Enterprise tier with organization-wide features

3. **Add-on Features:**
   - Advanced analytics of saved repositories
   - Custom integrations with developer tools
   - Priority support
